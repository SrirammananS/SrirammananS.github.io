            <div class="answer">
                Edwin Sutherland revolutionized criminology by introducing the concept of <span class="highlight">White Collar Crime</span> and developing <span class="important">Differential Association Theory</span>. He argued that criminal behavior is learned through social interaction, not inherited. His work shifted focus from individual pathology to social processes, emphasizing that crime occurs across all social classes, not just among the poor.
